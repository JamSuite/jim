# skills/file/scripts/jimalloc.sh — jim's ID-coordination allocator.
#
# PURPOSE
#   Hand out jim's IDs (spec ordinals, issue ordinals + durable issue ids, and
#   group names) through a shared, append-only registry so separate users on
#   separate clones never claim the same ID. Allocation appends a
#   compare-and-swap (CAS)-guarded record to a per-kind log on a dedicated
#   coordination branch, using git plumbing so the developer's working tree is
#   never disturbed mid-flow.
#
#   This is jim's first script to fetch/push and write a shared ref. The
#   coordination branch is writable by anyone who can push it, so every value
#   read back from the registry or from config is revalidated through
#   jimfile.sh's id/slug/path boundary before it reaches a git command, a ref,
#   or a filesystem path (the single security boundary — no fourth copy).
#
# CLI SUMMARY
#   bash jimalloc.sh allocate spec  <group> <subject>   → "<group>/<NNN>"
#   bash jimalloc.sh allocate issue <subject>           → "<full-id>\t<num>"
#   bash jimalloc.sh peek     spec  <group>             → advisory "<group>/<NNN>"
#   bash jimalloc.sh peek     issue                     → advisory "<num>"
#   bash jimalloc.sh resolve  spec  <group>/<NNN>       → current "<group>/<NNN>"
#   bash jimalloc.sh resolve  issue <num|full-id>       → current id
#   bash jimalloc.sh -c <path> <subcmd>                 use <path> as jimconf.toml
#
# EXIT CODES
#   0  Success.
#   1  Hard failure (unreachable coordination point / erosion detected /
#      retries exhausted / a rejected registry or config token).
#   2  Malformed invocation (missing argument, unknown subcommand).
#

set -uo pipefail
# LC_ALL=C — locale-independent text handling (matches jimfile.sh / jimconf.sh).
export LC_ALL=C
# Non-interactive git: a mid-flow credential prompt must never hang a consumer;
# an unreachable coordination point surfaces as a failed command, not a stall.
